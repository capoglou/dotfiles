## C++ Sublime Text Snippets

Made for C++11.

Uses this style:

```cpp
if(/* condition */) {
    /* code */
}
```

## Installation

There are two ways to install these snippets, with the first being the easiest with the 
[Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net). 

- Press Ctrl + Shift + P
- Type Install and you'll see "Package Control: Install Package"
- Type "C++ Snippets" and it should be the first result.

The other and arguably harder way to install the package is to go to your package directory and run 

`git clone https://github.com/Rapptz/cpp-sublime-snippet.git`


## Documentation
